## Problem
Given an array of ints, is it possible to divide the ints into two groups, so that the sum of one group is a multiple of 10, and the sum of the other group is odd. Every int must be in one group or the other. Write a recursive helper method that takes whatever arguments you like, and make the initial call to your recursive helper from splitOdd10(). (No loops needed.)

Input:
The first line contains a single integer n(number of elements) The second line contains n space integers

Output:
Print YES if its possible to divide it into two groups with given condition else print NO

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 100
-100<=a[i]<=100
